C++ adds several enhancements over C (which motivates the name
“C++”), with the principal enhancement being the object-oriented concept of a
class.
A class is a user-defined type that encapsulates many important mechanisms
such as guaranteed initialization, implicit type conversion, control of memory management, operator overloading, and polymorphism (which are all important topics
that are discussed later in this book). A class also has the ability to hide its underlying data. This allows a class to conceal its implementation details and allows
users to conceptualize the class in terms of a well-defined interface. Classes enable
programmers to break an application up into small, manageable pieces, or objects.
